## SELF INTRO

Hey Guys,<br>
I'm Harikrishna TP, a first year student pursuing Computer Science Engineering. I'm into coding mostly because it truly fascinates me to know what actually happens under the hood. What i understood from amfoss is that hardwork really pays off and its completely worth joining amfoss. For that, i'm ready to give my best to impress the mentors. joining amfoss would give me the freedom to explore and learn many things.

## INTROSPECTION
### WHY MUST YOU CHOOSE ME?
I have a pretty beginner level of knowlege about coding but I think the best part of me is that I always get excited to acquire more knowledge. Since childhood, I always had that thought of "How the hell does this thing work ???'. Whenever I get a new toy or literally anything, I open it up and try to understand how it worked (I even opened up a table fan and destroyed it). That mentality of mine is like probably the best thing about me. same thing goes for coding as well. SO, I'd say choosing me would be beneficial for me and the club aswell. 
### WHAT'S YOUR PLAN FOR THE NEXT 6 MONTHS? HOW WILL YOU ACCOMPLISH THEM ?
I think I have a lot to improve on my programming and problem solving skills. After doing all those tasks, I came to know how vast this "computer science" is. I did learn a lot and wish to learn a lot aswell. one thing I'd really love to learn is Webpage delevopment and do stuff related to bandit. Those were probably the most interesting ones I've done. My plan to accomplish them is mostly trying out hackerrank problems. My teacher told me about codechef. so, that's also included. I've already started doing some.
### HOW WOULD YOU CONTRIBUTE BACK TO THE CLUB?
In my openion, I'd do everything my seniors ask me to do. I'm ready to push my boundaries to excel in whatever I'm told to do.
###MY THOUGHTS AND FEEDBACK ON PRAVESHAN PROCESS
In my openion, this amfoss praveshan is probably the most challenging I did after JEE. Actually, I didn't think it'd be this hard but as time went on, things started to get challenging as well as interesting. I didn't exactly knew the worth and and reach of this club. Even though these tasks were challenging, I did learn within a lot which really feels good. In short, the Praveshan is pretty crisp and almost perfect.
