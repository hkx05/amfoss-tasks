# Project Euler

I did have prior knowlegde in cpp but didnt have much knowledge in python. I did attend some classes of CS50 and one of my friend gave me his udemy account to learn python. through all those means, I did some question by myself and for 1 or 2 questions, I had to learn more (functions and stuff). The palindrome question was one of the toughest for me. so, i went through a different approach. for some questions, the approach was clear in mt head but as i didn't have much knowledge, I had to do some reasearch.
