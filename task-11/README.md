# TinkerCAD

I've seen my father use AutoCAD before and I always wondered what he was doing. well, this is definitely different from autoCAD but I i did get what i expected. I loved how it had all kinds of instruments and it was as if i was playing minecraft (the only limit is your imagination). But when it comes to the task perspective, I didnt have much idea about the things mentioned in that so it kinda challenging i guess? So, i had to go through a few tutorials to fingure out the things. I'd say this task was pretty interesting.
