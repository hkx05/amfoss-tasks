# README.md

this task was probably one of the challenging ones ive done till now. i had no clue about hacking and stuff like that so i mostly relied on online sources. By the end of the task, after level 7 and all, things got pretty interesting and it was honestly fun to do. A pretty good and interesting task I'd say.
