# Hypertext Mockup Language

For me, this task was a bit on the harder side as i didn't know anything css. i had to constantly search the internet for all types of stuff but everntually, i understood how to use it and completed the task. I used to make simple webpages using html so that part wasnt so bad. Other than that,it wasn't that bad.
