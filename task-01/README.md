# Terminal Wizard
This task was pretty challenging for me. I took a lot of help from my friends and google (obviously) but finally i was able to succeed. Although it was hard for me but i still enjoyed it nonetheless. I could learn many commands with this task and I was able to understand how terminal worked and how actually it is done.
